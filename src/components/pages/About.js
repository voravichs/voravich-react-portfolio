      <p className='text-2xl text-yellow-100 ml-4 leading-loose'>My name is Voravich Silapachairueng. I was born in Thailand, but lived
        in the United States for most of my life. I had studied Cognitive Science
        at Brown University in hopes to pursue research, but decided to change
        my course and pursue software development and computer science instead.
        Thus, I am currently enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania for an
        MCIT to become a proficient programmer! <br></br>
          I love tabletop role-playing games, as I joined in with the recent rise of Dungeons and Dragons. This hobby, I believe,
        encompasses my love for telling and creating stories. Programming, in a sense,
        is very similar to telling a story, as I can set the scene with objects to
        interact with and set the results of users' actions. I hope this mission statement
        will evolve into a career working in fresh, new interactive media, such as VR, AR,
        and associated technologies.
