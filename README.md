## Description

This project is the start of a professional portfolio deployed on GitHub. It is a demonstration of how a React front-end app will function. 

## Usage Instructions

A user will start on the About Me page. On the header, there is a navigation bar that includes a portfolio, contact, and resume section.

The portfolio consists of 6 select projects to show in my portfolio. Hovering over these projects will bring up its title and a Github logo. Clicking anywhere in the box except the log will bring up the deployed app. Clicking on the Github logo will take a user to the project's github repository.

The contact section is a form that takes a name, email, and message. As this project is fully front-end, the submission currently doesn't work, but this will be addressed in the future.

The resume section includes a link to a google drive that contains my CV. This page also contains a list of my proficiencies and skills.

At the footer, there are persistent links to my github profile, linkedin profile, and twitter.
